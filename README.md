# Backend Python Journey

## Description
This code contains all we did during the allocated time we had. Thanks to our sponsors and teachers, we were able to learn python language, how to use frameworks (e.g., Flask), backend technologies, Postman, integration of APIs. We were able to build real-life solutions using the computer, building me to gain confidence in myself from assignments to personal projects.

## My Journey
It all began from just `print('hello world')` and now I am a problem solver. Using the act of coding is not just a technical skill, it holds immense power to transform one's mind from the quagmire of confusion and set them ablaze on a path of purpose and clarity.

## Lessons Learned
From consistency in my work, I've learnt that as a problem solver we should not run away from errors (bugs), but we should be able to face them because that's what makes one a great programmer.
